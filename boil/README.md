# Boil the ocean

We are rebuilding CPython with universal eight-byte PyValues, a register
interpreter, and a cohesive method and tracing JIT. Reference counting with
cyclic collection is the selected memory policy. Extensions are rebuilt and
ported; hard source or binary compatibility with upstream is not required.

## Where we are

The qualified interim interpreter is built from `eba351fee7d`: register IR and
NaN-boxed frame values, with boxed heap fields. Universal PyValues are being
restored across containers, attributes and core operations in a separate source
worktree. Many components have passed source review, but that composed source
is still uncommitted and has no qualified build or performance result.

**Current step:** the coordinator checkpoints reviewed source in coherent
commits, then finishes remaining consumers and validates the integrated runtime.
The wiki/assignment reset passed fresh independent review; previous agents are
stopped. No new runtime implementation owner is assigned yet. The
[work board](issues/README.md) names the next steps.

Next milestone: measure the unified-value register interpreter with JIT
explicitly disabled against matched interim RC and upstream controls. Then
continue the shared method/tracing JIT. No new JIT is in the interim images.

## Run the interim interpreter

```sh
./build/rc-integrated-release-20261101/python your_script.py
./build/rc-integrated-debug-20261101/python your_script.py
```

These are the earlier Linux x86-64/GIL/GCC builds with private `boilrc1` ABI;
they do not contain restored universal heap values. Profile and optional-module
limits are recorded in [RC integration](issues/rc-integration/status.md).
Upstream base: `321925c92c9`. Earlier tracing-GC work is closed; its
[decision](issues/gc-parity-deadline/decision-20261101.md) and evidence remain.
