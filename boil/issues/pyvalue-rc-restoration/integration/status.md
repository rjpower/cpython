# Restoration integration and interpreter checkpoint

- Stage: queued; dependency source is reviewed in parts, not yet committed
- Owner: coordinator; fresh independent integration/result reviewer required
- Goal: produce one coherent universal-value RC runtime, validate composition,
  then measure the register interpreter before further JIT performance work.

## Commit and integrate

Review the current composed worktree and create dependency-ordered source
commits. Preserve unrelated work and existing evidence. Avoid another long
uncommitted accumulation: a useful dependent source checkpoint can be committed
with its unqualified/non-runnable status explicit. Commit identity is not a
runtime pass. Merge reviewed increments and resolve shared interfaces in the
coordinator-owned integration tree.

Build as soon as the source dependency chain permits; fix concrete compile/link
and consumer gaps with scoped reviewed increments. Verify rebuilt extension and
private ABI identities. Execute focused lifetime, value, container, attribute,
iteration and native routes on the merged tree, then applicable broad release/
debug/C-extension/stress/sanitizer qualification. Follow [gates](../../../design/validation.md).

## Measure

Prove JIT execution is disabled, then compare the matched unified interpreter,
interim RC and upstream controls over the unchanged 29-workload roster. Preserve
raw vectors and report workload/aggregate elapsed and memory, separating startup,
lowering and warm execution. No restored timing exists yet; earlier RC/GC/JIT
results cannot supply it. Use results to improve specific mechanisms.

Next: after the wiki reset, checkpoint reviewed source and publish the exact
integration/dependency plan with a fresh owner/reviewer assignment.
