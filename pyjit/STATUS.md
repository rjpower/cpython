# Project status

The 2026-11-08 interpreter checkpoint is **golden**: frozen, qualified and
published at `pyjit-golden-20261108-runtime` (`0765e9be47f`). It is a baseline,
not a claim of upstream parity. The [manifest](issues/golden-20261108/README.md)
owns exact identities; the [performance report](bench/results/interpreter-parity-20261108.md)
owns the retained measurements.

## What works

- Universal eight-byte PyValues are integrated across the register interpreter,
  core containers/attributes and rebuilt bundled extensions. Owning bridges
  remain where direct-value operations have not replaced them; this is tuning
  work, not a second heap representation.
- Register lowering, explicit operands, constant homes, folded loads/stores,
  compacted slots, guarded specialization, monitoring and tail-call dispatch
  execute the normal Python workload. Calls use a frame stack and can overlap
  argument windows. See the [IR](design/register-ir.md) and
  [interpreter](design/interpreter.md) specifications.
- The selected batch integrates typed code homes, successful-refresh cleanup,
  a dictionary first-probe hit, checked NOP continuation and guarded general
  Python-call entry. Full qualification at functional `0267d428808` passed
  **54,394 tests each in release and debug, zero failures**. All three builds
  check 117 modules; API lint covers 306 units with zero failing findings.
  `0765e9be47f` moves an existing comment; the manifest records its binary check.

## Performance

Elapsed ratios below are candidate/control; lower is better. Protocols differ,
so compare within each row. All use GCC and explicitly disable the JIT.

| Comparison | Result | Limit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Logging / upstream | 1.3872 and 1.3786 | Two six-round campaigns; parity failed |
| Broad 29 workloads / upstream | 1.2412 | Two-round screen |
| Logging / retained R5 ELF | 0.8402 | Four rounds; both use current shared modules |
| Broad 29 workloads / retained R5 ELF | 0.9810 | Same shared-module limitation |
| Spectral / retained R5 ELF | 1.0860 | Repeatable regression, accepted in this batch |

Logging retires about 1.435× upstream's instructions and consumes 1.384× its
cycles. Added work is the main observed distinction. Samples point to argument
binding, frame retirement, method lookup and call/return handling; they do not
apportion a causal speedup budget. Spectral's regression has a measured CPI
penalty whose cause remains unresolved. Profiles have zero lost samples but a
retained perf metadata warning. See the report before interpreting samples.

## What remains

The [fresh cold review and next plan](issues/golden-20261108/next-steps.md)
own the next work. Keep the golden runtime immutable; changes start from it and
pass design → peer review → implementation → focused checks → post-review →
integration. Broad performance screens and full suites belong at coherent
integration points.

Executable NOP words are an implementation choice for source/monitoring anchors,
not a register-machine requirement. Their current continuation avoids dispatch
but retains word testing and PC updates. Metadata-only anchors need a coherent
mapping design. Nine logging result POPs still retire ownership and preserve
observation boundaries; dead-result lowering must account for both.

Borrowed frame views are a reviewed investigation, not an approved implementation.
Ownership anchors, GC traversal, promotion, ordinary fallback and a complete
consumer census remain open. The fresh review must weigh this against other
structural changes. Native JIT recovery/backend completion and external
extension adoption remain later stages in the [roadmap](ROADMAP.md).

Supported qualification is Linux x86-64/GIL with GCC 15.2.0. Free-threaded and
32-bit builds are unqualified. Startup RSS and a zero-box census are not
performance admission gates. The [cleanup audit](issues/golden-20261108/cleanup-audit.md)
records why legacy dirty/evidence-bearing worktrees remain. Prior boards are
[archived](archive/20261108/STATUS.md), not active assignments.
