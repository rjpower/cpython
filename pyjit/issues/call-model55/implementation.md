# Model55 implementation ledger

Status: active. The user authorized implementation of the reviewed M0–M7 plan,
Sol high-effort workers and coordinator integration. The
[plan](plan.md), [target design](../../design/proposals/register-call-model55.md)
and [review resolution](review-resolution.md) own the contracts. Selected54
remains unchanged until a candidate earns admission.

BASE=`/home/power/code/cpython/.worktrees/python-boil-the-ocean/build`.
Evidence E=`BASE/pyjit-link-wave1/call-model55`.

| Source under BASE/worktrees | Branch | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- |
| call55-integrated | pyjit/call55-integrated | Coordinator: composition and generated products |
| call55-pins | pyjit/call55-pins | Sol frames/calls: frame header, binding, lifecycle |
| call55-ir | pyjit/call55-ir | Sol IR/image: transfer metadata and common validation |
| call55-gc | pyjit/call55-gc | Sol GC/observation: collectors and external readers |

All start from immutable selected54
`61015a9452d9069646fb5fede9ff963896833b89`. Controls, selected source and
selected release/debug builds remain untouched. Initial integration builds are
`BASE/call55-integrated-{release,debug}`, using the selected54 configurations
and module flags. Root records generation/build/test commands under E and
commits reviewed source before measurements.

| Stage | State | Required next evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| M0 allocation/interfaces | Source census and concrete placement cost model independently reviewed. Shared arena plus initialized NULL named locals selected as M4 reference; split bases retain dirty-local fills and add addressing/reservation work | Measure actual dirty-local fills, chunk work and copy traffic at the static checkpoint; local validity remains a separate unimplemented alternative |
| M1 typed pins/admission | M1a typed pins dd3c9fc8d9e passes 932 focused tests per role and native/source review; hot confirmation mixed, no admission. M1b ce71fcfc240 passes 413 focused tests per role; two-pair screen still loses logging | Carry typed owned-function proof across call boundary; qualify and price composition |
| M2 shadow maps/roots | Worklist b75e9cc3201 passes 425 IR tests and four generated-contract tests per role. Persistent normal-return certificates, explicit retirement reasons and a cold comparison consumer are integrated through a95bcbbf836 | Complete callback/exception/observer phases and general owner maps; current certificate does not remove work |
| M3 all lifecycle readers | Provider/classify-once composition de95475accb passes 1,487 core tests, 28 C API cases and eight precise cases per role, has cold source/native GO and hot6/all29/PMU evidence. Constructor shim 05701020b6a integrated, generation pending | Retain NULL authority. Constructor native tests, heap deallocation and complete suspension/escape/reader coverage remain open; the shared-emitter increment is implementing meaningful nonempty phase shadows |
| M4 static switch | Not started | Atomic reader/collector/allocator switch and representation qualification |
| M5 bitmap comparison | Not started | Same placement/boundness/transfer ABI and complete measured lifecycle |
| M6 optional lowering | Not started | Independently attributable useful increments |
| M7 final selection | Not started | Integrated source/native review, qualification, retention and unchanged-workload comparisons |

The six-case hot set is DeltaBlue, generators, coroutines, Richards,
comprehensions and silent logging. Selected54 upstream confirmation ratios
are respectively 1.154663, 1.450207, 1.254281, 1.280930, 1.390876 and 0.712216.
These are historical direct comparisons with their published ranges; do not
multiply them by new ratios. Use direct selected54 and upstream controls for
new campaigns. See the [active report](report.md) for M1a results.

Full suites belong at coherent representation integrations. Preserve existing
debugger/LLTrace failures, GC-verifier instability and the unexplained full-run
profiling failure as explicit limits; do not add quarantines. The existing GDB
pretty-print quarantine remains unchanged. Source-only review does not count
as a runtime pass, and a source-level store reduction does not establish a win.

## Collector policy decision during M3 review

Keep ordinary native stack/register/PyMem conservative discovery as an explicit
policy in this checkpoint. GIL cyclic RC already preserves real counted C
owners without a root head; extra per-owner chains would mainly serve the
optional verifier and add stores on ordinary native calls. Do not conflate
removing arena enumeration with a fully precise native GC migration. M3 must
cover every active/staged/retiring arena and heap owner partition, including
native/provider/binder windows and dynamic prefixes. Scalar boxes remain live
leaf roots under native discovery. The [collector policy audit](collector-policy.md)
records the distinction and source costs. The [helper proposal](helper-roots-proposal.md)
prioritizes actual staged arena gaps rather than blanket C-local registration.
